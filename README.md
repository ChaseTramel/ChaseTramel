- 🦌 Hi, I’m Chase Tramel: 29 years old · any pronouns · near Orlando, Florida
- 💛 I’m interested in full-stack web development, UI design, and game development.
- ✨ I have curated several resources that may be of use to developers with similar interests:
  - **[frontend-dev-learning](https://github.com/ChaseTramel/frontend-dev-learning)** - Several documents including well-regarded courses to learn programming, most of them absolutely free. One learning program outlines learning [React.js and SSG](https://github.com/ChaseLittlepaws/frontend-dev-learning/blob/main/43.01%20React%20Developer%20Curriculum.md), while the another outlines learning [text-based game development](https://github.com/ChaseLittlepaws/frontend-dev-learning/blob/main/43.01%20React%20Developer%20Curriculum.md) with Twine and Inform 7.
  - **[Learning Resources](https://github.com/stars/ChaseTramel/lists/learning-resources)** - Resources on GitHub for learning front end web development, with a heavy emphasis on Javascript.
  - **[Cool Obsidian Plugins & More](https://github.com/stars/ChaseTramel/lists/cool-obsidian-plugins-more)** - Plugins on GitHub I use and or find fascinating, plus other related resources.
  - **[Second Life Utilities](https://github.com/stars/ChaseTramel/lists/second-life-utilities)** - Scripts and tools on GitHub that do interesting things in Second Life / OpenSim and or extend the capabilites of LSL.
- 🛍️ You can find many of my scripted items listed for sale in my [Second Life Marketplace store](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/244066).
